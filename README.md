# Netflix_EDA-Python-Project
This project explores the Netflix dataset (8,800+ titles) to uncover patterns and insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. The analysis focuses on understanding content distribution, genre trends, ratings, release patterns, and Netflix’s global growth.

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the data was cleaned, processed, and visualized to highlight meaningful relationships between attributes such as genre, country, release year, duration, and content type.

The project also identifies key insights like Netflix’s increasing focus on international content and the growth of TV shows after 2015.
